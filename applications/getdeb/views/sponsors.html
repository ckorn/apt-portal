<h3>What is a sponsor?</h3>
<p>
An individual, a project, a website or a company who sets up a recurring donation to help GetDeb financially on a montly basis.
</p>

<h3>How much does it costs?</h3>
<p>
The amount is decided by the sponsor. The more the sponsor gives the better but the important thing is to give something.
</p>

<h3>What are the advantages of this system for GetDeb?</h3>
<p>
By sponsoring GetDeb you contribute to giving the development team a regular and predictable income. 
This is the best form of income for GetDeb and for its developers/packagers to start working full time on it.
We want GetDeb to finance itself and are targeting for <b>200 &euro; per month</b> to have servers paid
and to upgrade the amount of bandwidth for the servers.
<p>

<h3>What are the advantages of this system for the sponsors?</h3>
<p>
Sponsors get their name associated with the success of GetDeb. 
If they have a logo we show it on the front page with a link to their website (each sponsor's chances of being shown is equal to the percentage his contribution represents among other sponsors)
