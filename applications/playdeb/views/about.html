		<h1>About PlayDeb</h1>
<p>
PlayDeb is an unofficial project with the mission to provide the latest open source and freeware games for the current Ubuntu Linux release, in an easy to install manner.
</p>
<p>
The PlayDeb repository extends the official repositories by providing latest versions and new games. Unlike the official packages, PlayDeb packages do not have a predefined release schedule - new game versions are provided as they become available from their authors.</p>
</p>
<p>
There is a short and limited testing phase instead of a full testing cycle to ensure packaging quality, however it is less strict than Ubuntu's official requirements.
You may also be interested on the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports" target="_blank">Ubuntu Backports</a> project. It has a limited scope compared to PlayDeb but the advantage of being an Ubuntu official project.
</p>
<p>There is no "company" behind this project - it is managed, maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group and by the users themselves.</p>
<p>Your help is needed and appreciated.</p>
