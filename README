Thank you for your interest in apt-portal, the mother project of
GetDeb.net and PlayDeb.net.

Please run the following commands before editing the code. This will ensure
the apt-portal server is running and that any subsequent changes you make to
the code does not break the application.


-----------
   Notes
-----------
 * You will need to be running Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.10 to run apt-portal code base.
 * apt-portal uses GitHub (git) for development; you will need to
   be familiar with git to be able to commit changes to the project
       - if you are not familiar with git and are uncomfortable with the
         command line, please see the tutorial found here:
         http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
       - in order to contribute changes you have to create a fork,
         push the changes there and send us pull requests:
         https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/


-----------------
   First Steps
-----------------
[Step 1] Checkout apt-portal code

git pull https://github.com/ckorn/apt-portal.git

(Or your fork directly if you want to publish changes.)


[Step 2] Change directory to wherever you downloaded apt-portal
         e.g. for $HOME/apt-portal/:

cd $HOME/apt-portal/

If you want to create a pull request, better branch from master:
git checkout -b my_awesome_feature


[Step 3] Make sure required dependencies are installed

sudo apt-get install python-mako python-elixir python-imaging python-cherrypy3


-----------------
   GetDeb Only
-----------------

[Step 4] Run instance of the GetDeb application
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view

./apt-portal.py -l getdeb


[Step 5] Populate the packages database

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.getdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu wily-getdeb apps


[Step 6] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and register a user. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 7] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py getdeb --add-admin your_username


------------------
   PlayDeb Only
------------------

[Step 4] Run instance of the PlayDeb application
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view

./apt-portal.py -l playdeb


[Step 5] Populate the packages database

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.playdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb games


[Step 6] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and register a user. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 7] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py playdeb --add-admin your_username


-----------------------------------------------
   Running GetDeb & PlayDeb At The Same Time
-----------------------------------------------

[Step 4] Run instances of both the GetDeb and PlayDeb applications
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view GetDeb
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8081 to view PlayDeb

./apt-portal.py -l getdeb&
./apt-portal.py -lp 8081 playdeb&


[Step 4] Populate the packages database for both GetDeb and PlayDeb

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.getdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb apps
debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.playdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb games


[Step 5] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and
         http://localhost:8081/register/ and register users. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 6] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py getdeb --add-admin your_username
./apt-portal.py playdeb --add-admin your_username
