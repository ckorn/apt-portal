Thank you for your interest in apt-portal, the mother project of
GetDeb.net and PlayDeb.net.

Please run the following commands before editing the code. This will ensure
the apt-portal server is running and that any subsequent changes you make to
the code does not break the application.


-----------
   Notes
-----------
 * You will need to be running Ubuntu 9.10 or 10.04 to run apt-portal code base.
 * apt-portal uses Launchpad and Bazaar (bzr) for development; you will need to
   be familiar with bzr to be able to commit changes to the project
       - if you are not familiar with bzr and are uncomfortable with the
         command line, please see the project called Ground Control, found here:
         https://launchpad.net/groundcontrol
       - Ground Control creates - or uses if it exists - a folder called
         Projects/ in your home directory. It takes care of the interface
         between Launchpad and bzr without forcing you to use the command line 


-----------------
   First Steps
-----------------
[Step 1] Checkout apt-portal code

bzr branch lp:apt-portal


[Step 2] Change directory to wherever you downloaded lp:apt-portal
         e.g. for $HOME/apt-portal/:

cd $HOME/apt-portal/


[Step 3] Make sure required dependencies are installed

sudo apt-get install python-mako python-elixir python-imaging python-cherrypy3


-----------------
   GetDeb Only
-----------------

[Step 4] Run instance of the GetDeb application
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view

./apt-portal.py -l getdeb


[Step 5] Populate the packages database

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.getdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb apps


[Step 6] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and register a user. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 7] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py getdeb --add-admin your_username


------------------
   PlayDeb Only
------------------

[Step 4] Run instance of the PlayDeb application
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view

./apt-portal.py -l playdeb


[Step 5] Populate the packages database

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.playdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb games


[Step 6] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and register a user. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 7] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py playdeb --add-admin your_username


-----------------------------------------------
   Running GetDeb & PlayDeb At The Same Time
-----------------------------------------------

[Step 4] Run instances of both the GetDeb and PlayDeb applications
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8080 to view GetDeb
         You can now browse to http://localhost:8081 to view PlayDeb

./apt-portal.py -l getdeb&
./apt-portal.py -lp 8081 playdeb&


[Step 4] Populate the packages database for both GetDeb and PlayDeb

debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.getdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb apps
debfactory/bin/apt2sql.py -fd  sqlite:////$HOME/.playdeb.db http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu karmic-getdeb games


[Step 5] You should now travel to http://localhost:8080/register/ and
         http://localhost:8081/register/ and register users. 
         If you dont have an SMTP service running on localhost you will get 
         an internal server error sending the authentication email, just ignore it.


[Step 6] Add yourself into the admin group will allow you to see a new menu entry "Packages".
         It allows you to classifiy packages an link them to application records.

./apt-portal.py getdeb --add-admin your_username
./apt-portal.py playdeb --add-admin your_username
